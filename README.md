This project is a **Tkinter-based Smart Home IoT Simulator** built in Python. It simulates common IoT devices with automation capabilities through a live GUI interface.

## 🧠 Features

- 💡 Smart Lights with adjustable and random brightness  
- 🌡️ Thermostat with adjustable and random temperature  
- 📷 Security Camera with motion detection simulation  
- ⚙️ Automation Rule: Turn on lights when motion is detected  
- 🖥️ Real-time GUI dashboard built with `tkinter`  
- 🔁 Background simulation using multithreading  

## 🚀 How to Run

If you're using the source code:  
`python main.py`

If you're using the Windows build:  
**Just double-click the `.exe` file** – no installation needed.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- No external dependencies (pure standard library)

## 📌 Notes

- This project is for educational purposes (university coursework).  
- It simulates IoT logic and GUI behavior in a simplified form.
